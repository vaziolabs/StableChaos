# The Stable Chaos Model

This project has grown exponentially more ambitious than ever before.

All of my ideas, converging into one.

 [ .. Read More ](https://github.com/BigStickStudio/StableChaos/blob/main/README2.md)

 [the Stable Chaos](https://github.com/vaziolabs/StableChaos/tree/main/Stable%20Chaos%20Model) model outlines the relationship between a dipole tranception or connection, and the [Tranception](https://github.com/vaziolabs/StableChaos/tree/main/Tranception) framework outlines the datatype that could be used to build out our framework.

## TODOS:
 - [ ] Build the 3d renderer for the model e.g. plug in Nova and define a renderer
   - [ ] Extern: Build Novas Python bindings
 - [ ] Rebuild this to be as simple as possible, including the stable chaos model
     - [ ] We need to be able to navigate a 3d grid or image
     - [ ] We need to be able to save to a wav but process as a workgroup
 - [ ] Run a simple +/-t where t = 0.1 - 0.001

 - [ ] Make configurations configurable i.e. 
     - [ ] maybe I want to lock max_depth, or max_width for number of forks per branch
     - [ ] definitely want to be able to determine if a flower is the end of a branch, or if flowers can happen in the middle
